# ZeepkistCustomCosmetics

Use assetbundles to import hats and zeepkists into Zeepkist.

To create an asset bundle, make sure to the game's version of unity (as of v9, it is 2018.4.34f1). As a base, rip a car and hat prefab from the game. Then, look at how the mod parses the asset bundle and figure it out from there.
